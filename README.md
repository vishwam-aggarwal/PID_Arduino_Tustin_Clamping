# PID_Arduino_Tustin_Clamping
PID library for Arduino, implementing the Tustin/Bilinear/Trapezoidal discretization method for discrete implementation. Supports Anti-windup using clamping of integrator (Integrator shuts down when saturation reached)
To learn more about Tustin Transformations look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_transform or any Digital Control Text Book.
